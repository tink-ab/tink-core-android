/**
 * A budget represents a financial target for a defined period. The budget itself is identified by certain filter/criteria (such as accounts, categories, tags or free-text) to target expenses. Defining multiple filter properties will yield an <code>AND</code> operation, and specifying multiple values of a filter property will yield an <code>OR</code> operation.</br>Depending on the use case a budget can either be recurring (<code>WEEK</code>, <code>MONTH</code> or <code>YEAR</code>) or be seen as a one-off budget (fixed <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> time period). The amount of the budget will relate to the recurring period defined by the periodicity unit for recurring budgets, or the fixed time window for a one-off budget. A budget could for example be the goal to spend at maximum 10 euros weekly on coffee.
 * @property id The ID of the Budget.
 * @property name The name of the budget.
 * @property amount The target amount for the budget.
 * @property periodicityType Tells whether the budget is recurring or one off type. Using this field it&#39;s possible to see which of the field &#x60;recurringPeriodicity&#x60; or &#x60;oneOffPeriodicity&#x60; is set.
 * @property recurringPeriodicity Periodicity configuration for a &#x60;RECURRING&#x60; budget.
 * @property oneOffPeriodicity Periodicity configuration for a &#x60;ONE_OFF&#x60; budget.
 * @property archived Indicates if the budget has state archived or not.
 * @property filter The filter defining the budget and which transactions that is included in it. The configured fields of the filter are applied as logical and operator (intersection).
