/**
 * Categories are used for categorization of transactions. They are structured as a category tree, and are available as a flat list of categories with parent/child relationships using their id and parent fields. Category information is used for pre-computed statistics, making aggregated spending and income data available for all the different nodes in the category tree. However, a transaction itself, can only be assigned to a leaf category. Both the `INCOME` and `EXPENSES` categories represent users' regular income and spending, while the `TRANSFER` categories are special in the sense that they represent transfers between accounts (potentially across banks), such as regular bank transfers, credit-card payments, mortgage amortizations and other transactions that should not add to the users' actual spending.
 * @property code Machine readable category code.
 * @property defaultChild Indicates if this is the default child to be used when categorizing to a primary level category.
 * @property id The internal identifier of the category, referenced by e.g. a transaction.
 * @property parent The parent internal identifier of this category, or null.
 * @property primaryName The primary name of this category.
 * @property searchTerms Used by the search engine to find transactions with this category.
 * @property secondaryName The secondary name of this category.
 * @property sortOrder Sort order for nicer display for the user.
 * @property type Type of the category.
 * @property typeName Type name of the category.
