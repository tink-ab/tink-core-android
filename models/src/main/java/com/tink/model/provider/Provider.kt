/**
 * The provider model represents a way of connecting to different banks or other financial institutions in Tink.
 * Multiple providers can exist for the same financial institution, each representing a different type of access the user can choose from.
 * The model contains metadata about the provider which can be used to group and properly display the representations,
 * thus helping the end user make the correct decision on which provider to choose.
 *
 * @constructor creates a new provider object. This is usually done inside the Tink framework. It should normally not be necessary to create your own provider objects.
 *
 * @property name the name of this provider. This serves as a human readable identifier
 * @property displayName the formatted name of this provider, meant for display to the end user
 * @property type The type of the provider. See [Type]
 * @property status The status of the provider. See [Status]
 * @property credentialsType Indicates which method will be used to connect this provider, for example with username/password or a third party app.
 * @property helpText a small help text that you can display to the user for further information on how to connect this provider
 * @property isPopular Indicates whether the provider is one of the major providers in a market. This can be used to provide shortcuts for the end user, for example by putting this provider on the top of the list.
 * @property fields the list of inputs that need to be filled to connect to this provider. See also [Credentials.fields]
 * @property groupDisplayName this can for example be used as a label for groups of providers
 * @property displayDescription a short displayable description of the authentication type used
 * @property images a wrapper class for images describing the provider, for example a bank logo
 * @property financialInstitution The financial institution the provider belongs to. See [FinancialInstitution]
 * @property accessType The access type of the provider. See [AccessType]
